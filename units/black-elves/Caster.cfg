    description= _ "It is well-known amongst black-elves that shamans, with their high sensitivity to the world around them, have never managed to adapt well to the underground world; still, only those who walk this path understand just how far that environment affects them. While forest shamans, if properly evolved, become radiant and kind Shydes, the most powerful and skilled Black-Elf shamans will become darkner and more callous as they try to fathom and embrace that dark and harsh world which their ancestors have chosen as their home. This takes them further away from the faerie world, but it also enables them to unlock new, mysterious powers with which they can drive even the bravest of warriors to madness."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_CURES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SLOW}
