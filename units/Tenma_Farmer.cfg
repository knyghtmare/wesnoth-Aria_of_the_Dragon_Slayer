    description= _ "Tenma Yozora was born in the small Sogen village of Kuroi; her parents, Yusuke and Motoko, died during Wesnoth's invasion of Kodakuni, and she has been raised by her fellow villagers ever since, though she was unoficially adopted by Natsu, a former priestess who was Motoko's closest friend. Albeit her usual demeanour is playful and childish, she has a spirit as strong and courageous as that of any warrior, though her brashness is her greatest flaw."
