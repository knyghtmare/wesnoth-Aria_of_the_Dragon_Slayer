    description= _ "There was a time when the life of a female dwarf was confined to a domestic setting; because of their physical frailty, they found no place in the warlike society in which they lived. Nevertheless, that changed in the time of Sigdral of the Aigathol Clan: she studied ancient Windsong cipher magic in order to carve runes even without a runesmith's hammer - which is too heavy for any dwarf female to wield properly. Her method proved not only as efficient as the runesmith's in regards to the carving of magic runes, but it also made their use in battle much more dangerous for their enemies. Having proven their worth, the Runic Arcanisters of the Aigathol Clan are often entrusted with guarding and administering their greatest libraries; the wisest amongst them have even become chieftains, leading their clan as skilfully as any dwarvish lord."
