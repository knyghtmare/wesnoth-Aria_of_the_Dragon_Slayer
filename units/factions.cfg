    description= _ "The Maat'Karians descend of Aragwaithi and Hannuks who journeyed from the Great Continent to Netjer-Ta led by Myra of Hiera'Shirsha. They get their name from the first city they built on their new land, Maat'Kare.
	
Maat'Kare's History is full of challenges and conflicts. The first of them concerned the Maat'Karians' consolidation as an unified culture: their ancestors, the Hannuks and the Aragwaithi, were historical enemies, and none of them was willing to abandon their own respective cultures to embrace the other's. This schism's most critical moment happened when a large group of Aragwaithi decided to abandon Maat'Kare and settle in Argea, a continent to the south of Netjer-Ta. It was Kun'lun, a Sage of the city's third generation, who found the way to unite both cultures: with the aid of her scholars, she revived the ancient language of the Windsong and made its learning obligatory in the the schools, later turning it into the city's official language. This common tongue broke many of the cultural barriers between both peoples; and it was so popular that, in the following generations, more and more aspects of the ancient Windsong culture were adopted by the Maat'Karians - including names and their main symbol, the Winged Protectress.

Maat'Karian society sets itself apart from most of the world's civilizations for two things. The first is that the power to rule the nation is not concentrated on the hands of a single person; rather, it's shared by two governing bodies, the Chamber of Sages, formed the nation's oldest and wisest individuals; and the Chamber of Lords, formed by the generals and the rulers of the towns and even villages. Since these Lords can be stripped of their title if the citizens are unsatisfied with them, one can say that Maat'Kare is a near-democratic nation. The second thing is the Maat'Karians' high level of education: even at the tiniest village, every child is sent to schools maintained by the Academy, and thought subjects such as History, Geography, Grammar and Math. Thus, they become very well-educated citizens, and are more participative in the country's politics. Furthermore, if the child shows signs of magical talents, he/she is granted a place at the Academy of Maat'Kare, which is arguably the best magic academy in the world for forming masters in nearly all areas of magic, including the Elemental and the Dark Arts.

The population of Maat'Kare has never been high. In order not to be forced to expand and take lands from their allies, the Maat'Karians are only allowed to have two children for couple - though this birth control was only established much time after Maat'Kare's founding. There's little internal migration amongst Maat'Karians, who generally live their entire lives in the cities they're born at.

The Maat'Karian nation's formed by many near-independent cities and towns all over the Land's End peninsula, in Netjer-Ta's utmost east, and in Tarkyn's Meadows, which separates the peninsula from the rest of the continent. There are also many Migdols - or armed outposts - in farther locations which are under Maat'Karian control, such as the Gnoll Swamps and the Windswept Cliffs.

Maat'Karians do not differ from other human peoples, even though they live in a different environment - that is, except for their resistance against high temperatures, a natural adaptation to the Land's End peninsula's heat and sunniness. On the other hand, they're more vulnerable to cold than most humans."

    {CHOMI_NAMES}

    description= _ "The Chomi are a people, or a confederation of culturally similar tribes, who lived on the northern shores of the continent of Arajunna. They were numerous, had relatively large cities and were good at sailing and trading, but weren't very strong in terms of military, and their settlements weren't fortified; thus, they were constantly being harassed by the neighbouring Washraha and, in rarer occasions, by the giants known as Deshra.

They stand out amongst the dwellers of Arajunna for their knowledge of seafaring skills. Indeed, the sea plays a large role in the Chomi culture, being the main source of the food they eat, the main defence against both Washraha and Deshra (who are both afraid of the sea) and the stage of many of their legends. Their vessels, albeit frail, can endure long journeys in the stormy seas to the north of Arajunna.

Each of the Chomi tribes is ruled by its own king; other than through commerce, those tribes didn't have any strong relationship with each other. Even though they do not excel at war, even the Washraha fear the day the Chomi cities-state will unite, for such a day might mark the beginning of a new era in the whole continent, such is the strength of the Chomi culture."

    description= _ "The nation of Washraha on Arajunna was formed when the Tarva dynasty came to power and united several squabbling tribes and city-states to drive out the giants known as Deshra. The ruler of the city-state of Shray Tahl, a warlord known as Tarva Pah, was responsible for uniting these cities-state. His army became known as the Washrajan, or knee-cutters, and they lent their name to the resulting empire.

When he became their first emperor, Tarva Pah became a fearful and paranoid man. He instituted a paradigm of isolationism and xenophobia, building a wall along their land borders as mighty Washrahan scouting groups watched over the savannah and the mountains surrounding his lands, swiftly putting a violent end to anyone who came exploring or seeking trade or refuge. These policies were carried out by his successors for generations; the Washrahan themselves often visited neighbouring lands and people, but with ill-intention: for in the belligerent Washrahan culture, the warriors must be constantly proving their mettle in combat, and so they are often raiding smaller foreign tribes, though seldom destroying any of them completely.

In the reign of Empress Sa-Tarva, however, the Washraha decided to expand, razing countless towns and villages and conquering vast extensions of land, becoming the absolute power in Arajunna. Their power became unrivalled indeed, and it could have expanded to realms far beyond their continent, were it not for the Washraha's almost superstitious fear of the sea."

Very little is known about them, other than the fact that they are hostile, highly territorial, not very bright and with no expansionistic urge - which is fortunate for the humans of Arajunna, for the Deshra, with their titanic strength and absurd resiliency, are not the kind of foe that can easily be defeated.

Nevertheless, the warriors of the Washraha nation have somehow managed to capture a few of them as they were still infants, and trained them to fight for the Tarva Dinasty. They've even managed to contact some of the least aggressive Deshra tribes, giving them fine golden armour (an item which the giants favour for both its beauty and its usefulness) in exchange of some young Deshra, often captured from defeated tribes. As they're trained by the Washraha, these Deshra do not become less uncontrollable and violent; much to the contrary, the fact that they've been taught new ways to smash their foes only makes them even more fearsome."

    description= _ "The Sogen tribes are the descendants of people who lived on the steppes of the Great Continent' Far East for many ages. Adept of horse-riding and dexterous at archery, they were the absolute lords of the steppes for more than four thousand years.

However, everything changed when the steppes became overcrowded. The abundance of crops sucked slender rivers crossing the steppes dry, and the soil became infertile. With plants dying out, the steppes became increasingly barren; when the Second Sun rose, the increased heat started a process of desertification in those once green lands. The steppe peoples, frightened by the changes and angered by famine, fought each other in a series of devastating conflicts, and most of them disappeared from the face of earth.

The only ones who survived that chaos were those who wisely chose to leave their ancestral land for the forested and wetter west. They settled in a land full of ruins of an once mighty empire which featured in their oldest legends, and called it Kodakuni, which, in their tongue, literally means 'Ancient Land'. Living in a land full of forests, hills and valleys opened new ways of life to the Sogen-Ningen, the People of the Steppes: some dedicated to farming and were called Yasai-Ningen, or Farming Folk; others dedicated to foot warfare and became known as Ken-Ningen, or Sword Folk; and those who insisted on preserving their ancestors' traditions and ways of life were known as Uma-Ningen, or Horse Folk."

The members of this group are mainly legendary creatures, whose existence is still ignored by some. Indeed those who had met this army rarely had such a long life to be able to tell it! Many legends are told about some of them, wherein sometimes they are evil wizards who draw their prey where they can be lethal (into the wood), other times they are told as good creatures living a nature-friendly and cheerful life. However, wise travelers usually avoid those places where the shadow of the trees eats the light and thousands glittering eyes are seen in the dark."

    description= _ "The Baryags are one of the many human civilizations on the Great Continent, rulers of the vast Emerald Plains. Their ancestors were both a human nation who lived on those plains since before Wesnoth's founding and an eastern people whom some believe to have been an offset of the Aragwaithi. They're known for their belligerence: in their culture, fighting skills are regarded as one of highest values, and so even a common peasant knows how to fight. This belligerence has led them to war countless times, first against the elves, then against the drakes and the orcs; and, when both of these enemies were too strong, they squabbled amongst themselves.

In spite of their aggressiveness, they can be extremely loyal allies and dedicated friends to those who earn their respect. When a great orcish sovereign rose in the north in 997 YW, the Baryags accepted allying with the Northern Alliance in order to fight him; in the centuries to come, Mhreghost - the unofficial Baryag capital, built by the plains' original inhabitants - welcomed many heralds from the Alliance.

The contact with the Northern Alliance led the Baryags to learn more about the world outside the plains, as did the expansion of the Wesnothian Empire towards their frontiers. Unlike the men of the Northern Alliance, the Wesnothians arrived at the Emerald Plains with arrogant demeanour and covetous eyes, and the result was that they were brutally repelled by the Baryags. For many decades, Baryags and Wesnothians fought each other in a series of conflicts known as the Emerald Wars. As of 1400 YW, the Emerald Plains remain under Baryag control, but Wesnoth still hasn't given up on conquering the region.

And one of the main responsibles for the continued Baryag presence in the region was Dragana Vasilya. Being the heiress of the House of Ivarik - the first High King of Baryags, son of an easterner man and a native noblewoman - she was to be the supreme ruler of her people, but, as Baryags usually only acknowledge the power of arms, she had to forge her authority with steel and blood. And such was her prowess as a fight and a commander and her charisma that she even managed to stop the Baryag lords from fighting each other. Her victory over the orcish sovereign Red-Eye Bork - the one moment in her people's History when the Baryags truly feared being destroyed - was decisive to establish her as the supreme authority in the Emerald Plains, faithfully followed and obeyed by all Baryags."

This is, of course, an erroneous belief, though a forgivable one; because of their preference for woody environments, few people know of the elves' high adapting skills, which may be greater even than the humans'. Furthermore, few know of how the elves were once given to exploring and colonizing: long before Wesnoth was founded, the elves wandered about the Great Continent, settling not only on uninhabited forests, but also uninhabited mountains and, surprisingly, even caves. Those elves who chose to live in the dark and harsh underground adapted to it, becoming as adept to the caves as the dwarves themselves; one of their adaptations was changing the elves' traditional green clothing for black garments, which earned them the name given by their forest kin."

    num_traits=4

    description= _ "The Avatars are the first sentient beings to appear in the universe. It is not known, even to themselves, how they came into existence; what is known is that they appeared as thinking manifestations of the forces which existed in unbound shape in the first aeon.

Some of the Avatars whose names have been heard by human ears were: Ananke, Demere, Vanadya, Nannan, Quezatla and Moriann. This is all the information on them that has survived to this day:

Ananke was the Avatar of Will, the Mind which bends everything that it at pleasure; it is believed that she was the first to appear, and the one who gave origin to all other Avatars; she also gave the ability of sentience to the most developed living beings.

Demere was the Avatar of Life, the Mother from whom the energy which gives matter the ability to move and evolve on its own has originated. Albeit loving of her children and fond of innocent creatures, she was somewhat fierce-tempered and wilful; she did not live on planets with harsh weather, and so only a few worlds sheltered living beings - her favourite being Irdya.

Vanadya was the Avatar of Magic, the living incarnation of the one energy in the universe that is truly eternal. She is arguably the most powerful of the Avatars - with the (debatable) exception of Ananke - and the last one to share her essence with others. It is told that she was extremely arrogant, and refused to share her true essence with others for many aeons, until she met a human man called An-Usrukhar, with whom she fell in love. After meeting him, she decided to give other living beings the ability of harnessing magic - though not everyone received such gift.

Nannan was the Avatar of Time, also known as Avatar of Wisdom, Balance and Death. Hers was the power over the flow of time, which she wisely did not share with anyone - though she did allow a few ways through which those with the keenest senses may see both the future and the past. She was also the one responsible for setting a finite lifespan on every living and sentient being in the universe, Avatars included, arguing that new generations are the key of evolution, and that they would not survive if the older ones persisted.

Quezatla was the Avatar of Light, the Mother of Stars and master of the Arcane, one of the most mysterious forms of energy in the universe. She was also known as the Avatar of Peace due to her calm, pacifist and helpful nature.

Moriann was the Avatar of Souls, twin sister of Quezatla, with whom she originally shared the mastery of the Arcane. Moriann was the first Avatar to die, as she sacrificed her own existence so that her Soul Essence might become souls for the countless living beings in the universe - for the soul was the link which connected Mind and body, and so it was needed for life. Her corpse still lay in the Land of the Dead."

Celestials believe that light and darkness each have power, and they choose as a culture to fight for the light, and to spread it through-out the world. They are a militaristic society with great law and order that gives them strength and unity which caries over into their style of fighting. The order and unified purpose of celestial society tends to make them form larger nations than the other factions giving the Celestials great military strength."
