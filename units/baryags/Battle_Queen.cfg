    description= _ "The Battle Queen of the Baryags, Dragana Vasilya, is widely known even outside the Emerald Plains - something which few of her predecessors can boast. And the reasons are many: her fierce beauty, which has attracted the interest of many lords of the Northlands; her outstanding skill with the sword; and her many deeds, the greatest of which are easily the union of the warring Baryag clans and the defeat of the massive orcish horde of Red-Eye Bork, which threated the entire North. But she still strives to achieve her greatest deed: to build a solid and fruitful alliance between the Baryags and neighbouring peoples. For she knows that, in an age where two suns scorch the earth and people grow ambitious beyond measure, those who don't wish to drown in the imminent chaos must unite."
