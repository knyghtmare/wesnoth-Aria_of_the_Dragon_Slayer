    description= _ "In our days, humankind is the most widely spread race in the world, having large settlements in every known continent; and it is also the most diverse of all. However, in the ancient days, humans did not know any of the lands beyond the shores of their native Arajunna; and in those days, there was one man who earned the respected of the many human tribes of that continent. Blessed by the Goddess of Magic herself, he was the first of all mages, and the first human to set out of his land to explore the realms beyond the seas, thus igniting amongst his fellow humans the desire to explore the vast green world.

Though he held no official position in any country, his wisdom was appreciated and admired by other humans like no other, and his advices were always welcome and often followed. He was a true leader of humankind, one who dedicated his entire life to helping his people establish themselves in the world. Such man was the first King-Under-the-Sun; whoever wishes to inherit his title must be one committed not to a country or a culture, but to humankind itself."
