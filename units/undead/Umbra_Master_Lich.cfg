    description= _ "In the History of the Maat'Karians, many were the mages renowned for walking a single path of magic: Kun'lun the White, Gebet of the Shadow Forest, the Fire Empress Sadjet... But no mage dared delve too deeply into the Umbra Arts. For a long time, such fact was used by professors as a evidence of how dangerous that path could be, for no master to dare walk too far into it. However, during the Years of the Double Suns some Umbra enthusiasts denounced this fear as pure prejudice, based on an ancient bias against the Lich-Lords of Skiron. Arguing that the Umbra Arts had never been properly understood due to this 'fear', those Umbra mages dedicated themselves to this specific path.

Paramount among these mages is arguably Wesir Amarnat. Despite his well-known penchant for ostentation, for many years he refused to show off his Umbra powers. However, during a war in which New Maat'Kare found itself besieged by an orcish army which outnumbered the city's entire population by 3 to 1; he presented his countrymen the fruits of his decades-long studies in a display of power which caused friend and foe alike to stand in awe. A chronicler who witnessed the event wrote that 'it was as if the balance of the dimensions had been broken, bringing the Land of the Dead itself upon the Living World'. After that battle, Wesir became known as the 'God of Death'.

As an Umbra Master and a distinguished member of New Maat'Kare's Chamber of Sages, he was an example of how one could retain sanity and lawfulness while immerging oneself in dark magic; but now, even his staunchest supporter would be troubled to find a trace of the old Wesir in his current self."
