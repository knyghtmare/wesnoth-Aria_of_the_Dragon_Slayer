Many consider Sadjet, the Fire Empress, the obvious choice; but there are some who argue - quite passionately, I must say - that you reached an even higher level than she did. Sadjet never single-handedly slayed dragons or destroyed the Wall of Heaven and Earth... (to the others) That's one of our cities defences, mind you."
