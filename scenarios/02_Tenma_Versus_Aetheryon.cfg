The Wesnothians will return, with more men and more equipment, next to which this troop brought by Aetheryon will look like a tiny raiding band. You must flee Kodakuni, and follow me to my country; we have the power to help your people find their freedom, and to help you find your destiny."

Wesnoth isn't the largest empire this world has ever known for nothing: they have vast steelclad armies with centuries-old experience in warfare; not only that, but they have mages capable of incinerating entire cities, and dark mages who can raise undead legions from all past eras to fight for them. If you think I'm overestimating them, just look at the heavens. See those two suns up in the sky? I'm sure you've already been told that one of them was placed there by Wesnothians."

If you follow me to my land, however, not only will you be able to hone your powers, but, also, you'll be able to bring powerful Maat'Karian armies to help your people. What's more, if you stay here Aetheryon will keep sending armies after you, and I don't think he'll spare your fellow villagers for long."
