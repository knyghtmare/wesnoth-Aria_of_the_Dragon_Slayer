However, it was the couple that urged them all to go to leave; Valerya's students decided to follow Tenma, hoping to find their master again."

That night, however, she allotted some time for herself. After Gil-Thelyon's funeral, she asked for the company of her brother, her friends and her still unofficial parents-in-law; Tenma had to hold back her laughter as she saw Natsu's reluctance as Kenshiro and Cornelya confessed their love for each other – though, in the end, the Sogen priestess was warm enough to hug her new daughter-in-law."

Dragana also stayed at Metheldur, but she promised that, should they need it, Tenma and Aeldhoryan could count on her aid."
