However, it was the couple that urged them all to go to leave; Valerya's students decided to follow Tenma, hoping to find their master again."

That night, however, she allotted some time for herself. After Gil-Thelyon's funeral, she asked for the company of her brother, her friends and her still unofficial parents-in-law; Tenma had to hold back her laughter as she saw Natsu's reluctance as Kenshiro and Cornelya confessed their love for each other – though, in the end, the Sogen priestess was warm enough to hug her new daughter-in-law."

Dragana also stayed at Metheldur, but she promised that, should they need it, Tenma and Aeldhoryan could count on her aid."

Tenma was heartened to see that the Northerners were trying to rebuild their homes, but that ended as they neared the Dwarven Doors, headquarters of the Northern Alliance..."

Even some of the more experienced mages had trouble invoking their spells, though the Umbra mages seemed unaffected."
